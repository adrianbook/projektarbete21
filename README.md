 - Create empty folder 'dbVolume' in root folder of your cloned repo
 - Run following command in root folder of entities 
    ./gradlew build
 - Run follwing command in root folders of toiletprojectbackend and toiletuserservice
    ./gradlew clean bootJar
 - Run following command in root folder of your cloned repo to populate table Roles in database
    docker docker exec -it db-dev bash -c 'mysql -u root -pYrgo2021 toiletdb < /scripts/init.sql'

Only a super admin can alter the roles of other users through the web interface. To create a super admin user you need to alter the database directly. Find the id of a user in the database toiletdb in docker container 'db-dev'. Insert this id and the id of the role 'ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN' from the table 'role'.

Commands:
    docker exec -it db-dev mysql -u root -pYrgo2021
    use toiletdb
    SELECT * FROM TOILET_USER //Find id of user to grant new role to
    INSERT INTO toilet_user_roles(toilet_user_id, role_id) VALUES(<myUserID>, 1)
